# Expand Test Coverage PRD

## 1. Overview
Enhance test coverage validation by including both unit and integration tests in our test suite execution and coverage metrics. This ensures comprehensive testing across all layers of the application.

## 2. Mission

### 2.1. Current State
2.1.1. 🔍 Only unit tests (tests/00-unit) are being executed and validated for coverage
2.1.2. 🔍 Integration tests (tests/01-live) exist but are not included in coverage metrics
2.1.3. 🔍 Pre-push validation only checks unit tests

### 2.2. Required Changes
2.2.1. 🕔 Include all test directories in test execution and coverage metrics
2.2.2. 🕔 Maintain high code coverage standards across all test types
2.2.3. 🕔 Ensure pre-push hook validates complete test suite
2.2.4. 🕔 Provide clear test execution feedback and reporting

### 2.3. Acceptance Criteria
2.3.1. 🕔 All tests are discoverable by pytest
2.3.2. 🕔 Coverage meets or exceeds 80% threshold
2.3.3. 🕔 Pre-push hook successfully validates all tests
2.3.4. 🕔 Clear test execution reports are generated

## 3. Implementation Plan

### 3.1. Plan Development
3.1.1. 🕔 Review current test structure and coverage
3.1.2. 🕔 Define target test organization and requirements
3.1.3. 🕔 Break down implementation steps
