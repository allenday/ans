# Implement Operational Logging

## 1. Overview
Systematic implementation of operational logging across the project to improve observability, debugging capabilities, and system health monitoring.

## 2. Current State
2.1. Inconsistent logging practices
2.2. Limited operational visibility
2.3. No standardized logging patterns
2.4. Missing critical system state information
2.5. Mix of raw logging.getLogger() and get_logger() usage
2.6. Inconsistent log level application
2.7. Missing log rotation and aggregation

## 3. Objectives
3.1. Define standardized logging patterns
3.2. Implement consistent logging across all modules
3.3. Capture critical operational metrics
3.4. Enable effective debugging and monitoring

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1. Standardization
4.1.1. âœ… Convert all raw logging.getLogger() to get_logger()
4.1.2. ðŸ•” Define explicit log level criteria:
   - ERROR: System failures, data corruption, critical errors
   - WARNING: Recoverable errors, degraded performance
   - INFO: Key operational events, state changes
   - DEBUG: Detailed flow information, debugging data
4.1.3. ðŸ•” Implement consistent error logging patterns:
   - Exception details with stack traces
   - Context data for error conditions
   - Operation state at failure point
   - Recovery actions taken

### 4.2. Enhancement
4.2.1. ðŸ•” Implement log rotation:
   - Time-based rotation (daily)
   - Size-based limits
   - Compression of old logs
   - Retention policy
4.2.2. ðŸ•” Add log aggregation setup:
   - Centralized log collection
   - Structured log validation
   - Performance metric aggregation
   - Log search and analysis capabilities
4.2.3. ðŸ•” Extend performance metrics:
   - Operation latency tracking
   - Resource utilization metrics
   - System health indicators
   - Bottleneck detection

### 4.3. Module Coverage
4.3.1. âœ… Audit and document all modules requiring logging
4.3.2. âœ… Implement logging in core system components
4.3.3. ðŸ•” Add operational metrics collection
4.3.4. ðŸ•” Ensure proper error and exception logging

### 4.4. Validation
4.4.1. ðŸ•” Define logging validation criteria
4.4.2. ðŸ•” Create logging verification tests
4.4.3. ðŸ•” Implement log analysis capabilities
4.4.4. ðŸ•” Verify logging performance impact

## 5. Success Criteria
5.1. All core modules have standardized logging
5.2. Logging provides clear operational visibility
5.3. Debug information is consistently available
5.4. Performance impact is within acceptable bounds

## 6. Dependencies
6.1. Python logging framework
6.2. Existing codebase structure
6.3. Test framework for validation

## 7. Constraints
7.1. Must maintain backward compatibility
7.2. Cannot impact system performance significantly
7.3. Must follow security best practices for sensitive data 

## 8. Additional Scopes
8.1. âœ… Update .cursor/ documents to clearly indicate that all sections and items must be numbered for unambiguous referencing.
8.2. âœ… Update .cursor/ documents to clearly indicate that emoji are to be used in PRD.md and CHECKLIST.md derived from their respective templates, according to "status indicators" described in PROMPT.md "status tracking".
8.3. ðŸ•” Identify and eliminate the bug that causes implementation to begin before tests are written / failing according to red-green-refactor methodology.
8.4. ðŸ•” Formulate a plan to add meetrics to BACKLOG.md to for monitoring tech debt. Metrics for:
  8.4.1. ðŸ•” Unit test coverage
  8.4.2. ðŸ•” Mock test coverage
  8.4.3. ðŸ•” Live test coverage
  8.4.4. ðŸ•” Docstring coverage
  8.4.5. ðŸ•” Pydantic or PydanticAI validation coverage
  8.4.6. ðŸ•” Operational logging coverage (TBD how to measure)
  8.4.7. ðŸ•” Cyclomatic complexity metrics
8.5. âœ… Identify and eliminate the .cursor/ documentation bug that is preventing agent from automatically:
  8.5.1. âœ… Updating PRD.md or CHECKLIST.md when completing an item.
  8.5.2. âœ… Creating git add/commit for each bullet being completed from CHECKLIST.md and/or PRD.md
8.6. âœ… I propose that all documents in .cursor/ use numbered sections and items and refrain from using bullets. Lead by example how we want all docs to be formatted.
