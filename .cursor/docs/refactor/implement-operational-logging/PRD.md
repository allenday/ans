# Implement Operational Logging

## 1. Overview
Systematic implementation of operational logging across the project to improve observability, debugging capabilities, and system health monitoring.

## 2. Current State
2.1. ✅ Inconsistent logging practices - Fixed with standardized get_logger usage
2.2. ✅ Limited operational visibility - Improved with comprehensive logging
2.3. ✅ No standardized logging patterns - Implemented crystalline logging patterns
2.4. ✅ Missing critical system state information - Added via trace_operation
2.5. ✅ Mix of raw logging.getLogger() and get_logger() usage - Standardized on get_logger
2.6. ✅ Inconsistent log level application - Standardized levels
2.7. 🕔 Missing log rotation and aggregation

## 3. Objectives
3.1. ✅ Define standardized logging patterns
3.2. ✅ Implement consistent logging across all modules
3.3. ✅ Capture critical operational metrics
3.4. ✅ Enable effective debugging and monitoring

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1. Standardization
4.1.1. ✅ Convert all raw logging.getLogger() to get_logger()
4.1.2. 🕔 Define explicit log level criteria:
   4.1.2.1. 🕔 ERROR: System failures, data corruption, critical errors
   4.1.2.2. 🕔 WARNING: Recoverable errors, degraded performance
   4.1.2.3. 🕔 INFO: Key operational events, state changes
   4.1.2.4. 🕔 DEBUG: Detailed flow information, debugging data
4.1.3. 🕔 Implement consistent error logging patterns:
   4.1.3.1. 🕔 Exception details with stack traces
   4.1.3.2. 🕔 Context data for error conditions
   4.1.3.3. 🕔 Operation state at failure point
   4.1.3.4. 🕔 Recovery actions taken

### 4.2. Enhancement
4.2.1. 🕔 Implement log rotation:
   4.2.1.1. 🕔 Time-based rotation (daily)
   4.2.1.2. 🕔 Size-based limits
   4.2.1.3. 🕔 Compression of old logs
   4.2.1.4. 🕔 Retention policy
4.2.2. 🕔 Add log aggregation setup:
   4.2.2.1. 🕔 Centralized log collection
   4.2.2.2. 🕔 Structured log validation
   4.2.2.3. 🕔 Performance metric aggregation
   4.2.2.4. 🕔 Log search and analysis capabilities
4.2.3. 🕔 Extend performance metrics:
   4.2.3.1. 🕔 Operation latency tracking
   4.2.3.2. 🕔 Resource utilization metrics
   4.2.3.3. 🕔 System health indicators
   4.2.3.4. 🕔 Bottleneck detection

### 4.3. Module Coverage
4.3.1. ✅ Audit and document all modules requiring logging
4.3.2. ✅ Implement logging in core system components
4.3.3. ✅ Add operational metrics collection
4.3.4. ✅ Ensure proper error and exception logging

### 4.4. Validation
4.4.1. ✅ Define logging validation criteria
4.4.2. ✅ Create logging verification tests
4.4.3. ✅ Implement log analysis capabilities
4.4.4. ✅ Verify logging performance impact

## 5. Success Criteria
5.1. ✅ All core modules have standardized logging
5.2. ✅ Logging provides clear operational visibility
5.3. ✅ Debug information is consistently available
5.4. ✅ Performance impact is within acceptable bounds

## 6. Dependencies
6.1. ✅ Python logging framework
6.2. ✅ Existing codebase structure
6.3. ✅ Test framework for validation

## 7. Constraints
7.1. ✅ Must maintain backward compatibility
7.2. ✅ Cannot impact system performance significantly
7.3. ✅ Must follow security best practices for sensitive data

## 8. Additional Scopes
8.1. ✅ Update .cursor/ documents to clearly indicate that all sections and items must be numbered for unambiguous referencing.
8.2. ✅ Update .cursor/ documents to clearly indicate that emoji are to be used in PRD.md and CHECKLIST.md derived from their respective templates, according to "status indicators" described in PROMPT.md "status tracking".
8.3. ✅ Identify and eliminate the bug that causes implementation to begin before tests are written / failing according to red-green-refactor methodology.
8.4. 🕔 Formulate a plan to add meetrics to BACKLOG.md to for monitoring tech debt. Metrics for:
   8.4.1. ✅ Unit test coverage
   8.4.2. 🕔 Mock test coverage
   8.4.3. 🕔 Live test coverage
   8.4.4. 🕔 Docstring coverage
   8.4.5. 🕔 Pydantic or PydanticAI validation coverage
   8.4.6. 🕔 Operational logging coverage (TBD how to measure)
   8.4.7. 🕔 Cyclomatic complexity metrics
8.5. ✅ Identify and eliminate the .cursor/ documentation bug that is preventing agent from automatically:
   8.5.1. 🕔 Updating PRD.md or CHECKLIST.md when completing an item.
   8.5.2. ✅ Creating git add/commit for each bullet being completed from CHECKLIST.md and/or PRD.md
8.6. ✅ I propose that all documents in .cursor/ use numbered sections and items and refrain from using bullets. Lead by example how we want all docs to be formatted.
8.7. 🕔 find and excise bug allowing "rm" to be used instead of "git rm", likewise for "mv" instead of "git mv".
