🔒 REFACTOR SPECIFICATION
# Implement Operational Logging

## 1. Overview
Systematic implementation of operational logging across the project to improve observability, debugging capabilities, and system health monitoring.

## 2. Current State
2.1. Inconsistent logging practices
2.2. Limited operational visibility
2.3. No standardized logging patterns
2.4. Missing critical system state information
2.5. Mix of raw logging.getLogger() and get_logger() usage
2.6. Inconsistent log level application
2.7. Missing log rotation and aggregation

## 3. Objectives
3.1. Define standardized logging patterns
3.2. Implement consistent logging across all modules
3.3. Capture critical operational metrics
3.4. Enable effective debugging and monitoring

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1. Standardization
4.1.1. ✅ Convert all raw logging.getLogger() to get_logger()
4.1.2. 🕔 Define explicit log level criteria:
   - ERROR: System failures, data corruption, critical errors
   - WARNING: Recoverable errors, degraded performance
   - INFO: Key operational events, state changes
   - DEBUG: Detailed flow information, debugging data
4.1.3. 🕔 Implement consistent error logging patterns:
   - Exception details with stack traces
   - Context data for error conditions
   - Operation state at failure point
   - Recovery actions taken

### 4.2. Enhancement
4.2.1. 🕔 Implement log rotation:
   - Time-based rotation (daily)
   - Size-based limits
   - Compression of old logs
   - Retention policy
4.2.2. 🕔 Add log aggregation setup:
   - Centralized log collection
   - Structured log validation
   - Performance metric aggregation
   - Log search and analysis capabilities
4.2.3. 🕔 Extend performance metrics:
   - Operation latency tracking
   - Resource utilization metrics
   - System health indicators
   - Bottleneck detection

### 4.3. Module Coverage
4.3.1. ✅ Audit and document all modules requiring logging
4.3.2. ✅ Implement logging in core system components
4.3.3. 🕔 Add operational metrics collection
4.3.4. 🕔 Ensure proper error and exception logging

### 4.4. Validation
4.4.1. 🕔 Define logging validation criteria
4.4.2. 🕔 Create logging verification tests
4.4.3. 🕔 Implement log analysis capabilities
4.4.4. 🕔 Verify logging performance impact

## 5. Success Criteria
5.1. All core modules have standardized logging
5.2. Logging provides clear operational visibility
5.3. Debug information is consistently available
5.4. Performance impact is within acceptable bounds

## 6. Dependencies
6.1. Python logging framework
6.2. Existing codebase structure
6.3. Test framework for validation

## 7. Constraints
7.1. Must maintain backward compatibility
7.2. Cannot impact system performance significantly
7.3. Must follow security best practices for sensitive data 

## 8. Additional Scopes
8.1. ✅ Update .cursor/ documents to clearly indicate that all sections and items must be numbered for unambiguous referencing.
8.2. ✅ Update .cursor/ documents to clearly indicate that emoji are to be used in PRD.md and CHECKLIST.md derived from their respective templates, according to "status indicators" described in PROMPT.md "status tracking".
8.3. 🕔 Identify and eliminate the bug that causes implementation to begin before tests are written / failing according to red-green-refactor methodology.
8.4. 🕔 Formulate a plan to add meetrics to BACKLOG.md to for monitoring tech debt. Metrics for:
  8.4.1. 🕔 Unit test coverage
  8.4.2. 🕔 Mock test coverage
  8.4.3. 🕔 Live test coverage
  8.4.4. 🕔 Docstring coverage
  8.4.5. 🕔 Pydantic or PydanticAI validation coverage
  8.4.6. 🕔 Operational logging coverage (TBD how to measure)
  8.4.7. 🕔 Cyclomatic complexity metrics
8.5. ✅ Identify and eliminate the .cursor/ documentation bug that is preventing agent from automatically:
  8.5.1. ✅ Updating PRD.md or CHECKLIST.md when completing an item.
  8.5.2. ✅ Creating git add/commit for each bullet being completed from CHECKLIST.md and/or PRD.md
8.6. ✅ I propose that all documents in .cursor/ use numbered sections and items and refrain from using bullets. Lead by example how we want all docs to be formatted.
