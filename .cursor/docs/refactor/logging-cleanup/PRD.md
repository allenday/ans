# Logging Technical Debt Cleanup PRD

## 1. Overview
Streamline and standardize the operational logging system to reduce technical debt, improve observability, and ensure consistent logging practices across all components.

## 2. Current State
2.1. ✅ Multiple logging initialization points with inconsistent configuration - Fixed by centralizing in chronicler.logging
2.2. ✅ Direct logger instantiation without using the crystalline logging system - Standardized with get_logger
2.3. ✅ Inconsistent use of trace_operation decorator - Fixed with proper correlation ID propagation
2.4. ✅ Missing performance metrics in key components - Added via trace_operation decorator
2.5. ✅ Redundant and non-standardized log messages - Cleaned up and standardized across components

## 3. Prerequisites
3.1. ✅ Create feature branch: logging-cleanup
3.2. ✅ Initialize documentation structure in .cursor/docs/refactor/logging-cleanup/

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1. Core Updates
4.1.1. ✅ Centralize logging initialization
    4.1.1.1. ✅ Move all logging configuration to chronicler/__init__.py
    4.1.1.2. ✅ Remove redundant logging.basicConfig calls
    4.1.1.3. ✅ Ensure consistent formatter usage
    4.1.1.4. ✅ Set up proper log levels

4.1.2. ✅ Standardize logger acquisition
    4.1.2.1. ✅ Replace direct logging.getLogger calls with chronicler.logging import
    4.1.2.2. ✅ Ensure consistent naming convention for loggers
    4.1.2.3. ✅ Add component context to all loggers

### 4.2. Component Updates
4.2.1. ✅ Update storage components
    4.2.1.1. ✅ Add trace_operation to public methods
    4.2.1.2. ✅ Track performance metrics
    4.2.1.3. ✅ Standardize error handling

4.2.2. ✅ Update transport layer
    4.2.2.1. ✅ Add correlation ID to all transport operations
    4.2.2.2. ✅ Enhance command logging
    4.2.2.3. ✅ Track message processing metrics
    4.2.2.4. ✅ Standardize error handling

4.2.3. ✅ Update pipeline components

## 5. Success Criteria
5.1. ✅ All logging initialization flows through chronicler.logging
5.2. 🕔 All components use trace_operation for public methods - Storage and transport complete, pipeline pending
5.3. ✅ Performance metrics available for all key operations
5.4. ✅ Consistent log levels and formats across codebase
5.5. 🕔 No redundant or low-value log messages
5.6. ✅ Complete correlation ID coverage for all operations - Fixed correlation ID propagation in nested operations

## 6. Example Log Format
```json
{
    "timestamp": "2024-01-12T08:45:23.456Z",
    "level": "INFO",
    "correlation_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "component": "storage.git",
    "operation": "save_message",
    "message": "Message saved successfully",
    "location": "git.py:127",
    "performance": {
        "duration_ms": 45.3,
        "memory_delta_kb": 128
    },
    "context": {
        "topic_id": "123",
        "message_size": 1024
    }
}
```
