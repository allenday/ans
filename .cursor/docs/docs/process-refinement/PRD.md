# Process Refinement PRD

## 1. Overview
Refine the `.cursor/` documents to ensure they support operational consistency and align with the process outlined in `NOTES.md`. This involves updating templates, aligning documents with conventions, and establishing a feedback loop for continuous improvement.

## 2. Current State
2.1. 👷 Existing documents are not fully aligned with the desired process, leading to inefficiencies.
2.2. 👷 Lack of synergy and operational consistency across documents.
2.3. 👷 Need to ensure documents are MECE and support the outlined process for clarity and efficiency.
2.4. ✅ Checklist needs to be a static document that reflects the process currently outlined in NOTES.md.
2.5. ✅ PRD.template.md (and thus PRD.md) needs to be updated so that it reflects the dev loop currently outlined in NOTES.md. This way we can recursively refine the PRD to fully describe the implementation plan with numbered items and status emoji.
2.6. ✅ Conventions.md needs to be updated to reflect the conventions currently outlined in NOTES.md, keeping MECE principles in mind.
2.7. ✅ Rename `CHECKLIST.template.md` to `CHECKLIST.md` to make it a static document and remove the copy steps from the documentation process.
2.8. ✅ Update `PRD.template.md` to reflect the development loop outlined in `NOTES.md`, including numbered items and status emojis.
2.9. ✅ Update `CONVENTIONS.md` to align with the conventions in `NOTES.md` and ensure MECE principles are maintained.
2.10. 👷 Review and align `PROMPT.md` to support the process goals and operational consistency.
2.11. ✅ Establish feedback loop through STOP conditions and BACKLOG.md usage.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1. Core Updates
3.1.1. 🕔 Ensure `PROMPT.md` aligns with the process goals and provides clear guidance.
3.1.2. 🕔 Verify linked documents support operational flow and are consistent with the process.
3.1.3. 🕔 Ensure all documents are MECE, providing a comprehensive and non-overlapping framework.
3.1.4. ✅ Rename `CHECKLIST.template.md` to `CHECKLIST.md` and update documentation to reflect this change.
3.1.5. ✅ Update `PRD.template.md` to reflect the development loop outlined in `NOTES.md`.
3.1.6. ✅ Update `CONVENTIONS.md` to align with the conventions in `NOTES.md`.
3.1.7. 🕔 Review and align `PROMPT.md` to support the process goals.
3.1.8. ✅ Implement feedback loop:
   3.1.8.1. ✅ Add STOP conditions to CHECKLIST.md
   3.1.8.2. ✅ Define BACKLOG.md usage conventions
   3.1.8.3. ✅ Document exception handling in CONVENTIONS.md

### 3.2. New Features
3.2.1. ✅ Implement feedback loop for continuous improvement:
